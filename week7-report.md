# Lab Report 4: Vim

---
For this lab report I will reproduce the vim task from lab but I will take screenshots and record keystrokes at every step.

Before starting the timer/task I will note that I have already ran this task prior to this trial and thus have a history of terminal commands that I will reuse using arrow keys. My keystrokes and explanation will be included at every step so that there is no confusion. Additionally I will start with the clone url of the lab7 directory already copied to my clipboard.
